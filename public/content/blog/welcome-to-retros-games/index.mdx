Welcome to retros.games! The best games site on the Internet just got better with a new redesign.

We'll keep this brief since we want you to check out [the games we have to offer](/), but retros.games will **become the new home of retrosite, or Retro**. We will still keep offering [our old site](https://sites.google.com/view/retrosite/home), but it will no longer receive any updates and we strongly advise everyone move over to the new site. We will continue to update this site for as long as it's up.

In addition to more games, alphabetical/by date sorting, genres, and a fancy new design, games now offer fullscreen! Every game on the site now has fullscreen, allowing you to take advantage of the whole site. We also have a new [Discord server!](https://discord.gg/jMD9VBnRjK). Chat with like-minded gamers and get updates from the site directly over Discord.

Thank you, each and every person that has supported retrosite, as we enter this new era!

*P.S: Check out the [monkeys](/monkeys).*
