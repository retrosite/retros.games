First off, I wanted to thank you all so much for being here on the site.

So I first want to talk about the old retrosite. As many of you have seen most games on the site have not been working and just link to another site. If you have read his blog he made you'll know that the situation we're in is kind of difficult so we're most likely discontinuing the original retrosite. I apologize to the users that continue to use the old site for the inconvenience. We don't know what we will do with it but for now we'll just transfer it to a landing page that takes you to the new site.

But to all people who have already come over fully thank you for being here. I appreciated you guys all so much for getting on the retrosite and playing the games there but those who are willing to spread my site and moving over. I know it can be alot of work getting used to a new UI and a new template and sadly losing some games along the way. Although we have lost some of the games we will be getting the best of the old site and moving it.

At this point the new site is open fully but when I say this I want it to be noted we're still working on it obviously and we're still debating connecting the retros.games domain.
But alot of games are out (although most without images) and mostly flash but we are getting the best of the best games that we can.

Again, thank you all for being there for me and the team. You guys are actually the best.
